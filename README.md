- Java Script.

Developer Enviroment based on:

- VS Code;

- Node.JS.

## Project history

### Version 2.0
Currently the application works without reloading the page. 
Java Script code consists of three components:
1. component controlling the application;
2. component supporting the graphic part;
3. component supporting the calculation part.

In addition, version 2.0 improved:

- mechanism for drawing questions so that the questions do not repeat during one session;
- improved reset of saved data in Session Storage;
- application appearance.

In this application, for the first time, I used JS code validation using Eslint. I removed all errors except those that indicate too long functions.

Next steps:
- I wonder how to add to the final board a summary of incorrect answers indicating the correct ones.
- I would like to add more questions to the pool, so if you have any questions, let me know.

### Version 1.0
There are 20 questions in the application, of which User receives 10. Answers are sent using the form and the data stored in Session Storage. At the end of the test, a result is generated depending on the number of correct answers.
